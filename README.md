User Experience Design - UX
===========================

  

Strategy
--------

  

The business is a bakery shop called Dominic & Hansel established 1 year ago, in that time they have provided customers with world class service and the products they produce all with high quality ingredients and beautiful design to indulge customers and empower them to have their best moments in life sharing with their friends and family.

  

This section is where we have established user stories to identify website functionality. The initiative is to build a website that will promote our shop, bring convenience to customers and visitors by letting them order online, get our business known to a bigger audience.

  

*   **User Stories**

  

1.  As a First Time User, I want to be presented with a well structured and designed website, so I can intuitively navigate through the website and access the information I seek.
2.  As a First Time User, I want to be able to get back to the home page quickly and easily, so I don't waste time on going back and forth for what I need.
3.  As a First Time User, I want to be able to see pictures of all the products are sold by the shop, so I can browse through it and choose the one that most catches my attention.
4.  As a First Time User, I want to know in a glance what the website is about and why I should make a purchase, so I can make an informed decision whether to buy or not.
5.  As a First Time User, I want to know prices for all products, so I can know if my budget is sufficient to purchase it.
6.  As a First Time User, I want to be able to order cakes to be delivered to my home, so I can save time by having the convenience of home delivery.
7.  As a First Time User, I want to have special occasion section, so cakes can be bespoke based on my needs.
8.  As a First Time User, I want to change the website colour, so if I am colour blind the website will be more accessible.
9.  As a First Time User, I want to see reviews about their products, so I can understand what others think about the company.
10.  As a Returning User, I want to have a section where I can see their social media links, so I can follow them to get new updates.
11.  As a Returning User, I want to have a section where I can contact the Bakery, when I have questions about the company.
12.  As a Returning User, I want to easily login to my account, so I can make a purchase.
13.  As a Frequent User, I want to have a section where I can sign up for newsletter, so I can get the latest offers and news about the shop.
14.  As a Frequent User, I want a booking a table, so I can reserve ahead of time in case its busy.

  

Scope
-----

  

*   **Functional Specifications**

  

*   The functional specification will be based on the [assessment criteria](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GBoEwg5ODXp1Gg3oJJdXYpELdO7_s3MP/view?usp=sharing) and user stories.

  

*   **Content Requirements**

  

*   The content required to bring value are the following:

  

1.  The written content has to be concise and to the point, relevant to the section of the website. It has to follow the same typography to maintain consistency throughout the website.
2.  The imagery has to be consistent throughout the website in terms of colours and sizes.
3.  The colours has to be consistent with the logo colours to bring a theme based to the visitors.
4.  The typography will have consistency between written content and logo. It is important that the website will have one typography for the logo and one for the content.
5.  The logo has to bring set the tone for the look and feel of the website so that the other parts can follow it nicely.
6.  All information to have the right amount of contrast between foreground and background to avoid distractions.

  

Structure & Skeleton
--------------------

  

I have designed the structure and skeleton using Balsamiq to layout how I would implement sections of the website. I have started by doing a sitemap of how I would structure the website, following that I have laid out all the wireframes using low fidelity wireframing.

Surface
-------

At this stage I have chosen the Colours, Typography, Logo and Images.

  

*   **Design Choices**

  

1.  Colours - you can view my colour palette [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UCfpu3mklf5q-NEgOSEBL4i2vkdrQvGQ/view?usp=sharing). The palette was created based on the logo.
2.  Typography - I will use Playflair Display (Medium Metallic) for the Logo and Montserrat (Regular) for the content.
3.  Images - I will use [Pixabay](https://www.pixabay.com) and [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com) to source the images.
4.  Logo - I will use [canva](https://www.canva.com) will be used to design logo and favicon.

  

Below you will see all the pages using high fidelity software Figma. I decided to use Figma to plot the website so that the look and feel gets as close as possible to the real implementation before I start any code. The main reason behind this is much easier for me to change things at design stage than at coding stage, as well as it would get close to the end product.
