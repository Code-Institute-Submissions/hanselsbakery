</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Functional Specifications</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The functional specification will be based on the [assessment criteria (<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GBoEwg5ODXp1Gg3oJJdXYpELdO7_s3MP/view?usp=sharing">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GBoEwg5ODXp1Gg3oJJdXYpELdO7_s3MP/view?usp=sharing</a>) and user stories.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Content Requirements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The content required to bring value are the following:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The written content has to be concise and to the point, relevant to the section of the website. It has to follow the same typography to maintain consistency throughout the website.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The imagery has to be consistent throughout the website in terms of colours and sizes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The colours has to be consistent with the logo colours to bring a theme based to the visitors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The typography will have consistency between written content and logo. It is important that the website will have one typography for the logo and one for the content.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The logo has to bring set the tone for the look and feel of the website so that the other parts can follow it nicely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All information to have the right amount of contrast between foreground and background to avoid distractions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="structure--skeleton">Structure &amp; Skeleton</h2>
<p>I have designed the structure and skeleton using Balsamiq to layout how I would implement sections of the website. I have started by doing a sitemap of how I would structure the website, following that I have laid out all the wireframes using low fidelity wireframing.</p>

<h2 id="surface">Surface</h2>
<p>At this stage I have chosen the Colours, Typography, Logo and Images.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Design Choices</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Colours</strong> - you can view my colour palette <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UCfpu3mklf5q-NEgOSEBL4i2vkdrQvGQ/view?usp=sharing">here</a>. The palette was created based on the logo.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Typography</strong> - I will use Playflair Display (Medium Metallic) for the Logo and Montserrat (Regular) for the content from <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google Fonts</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Images</strong> - I will use <a href="https://www.pixabay.com">Pixabay</a> and <a href="https://www.pexels.com">Pexels</a> to source the images.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Logo</strong> - I will use <a href="https://www.canva.com">Canva</a> will be used to design logo and favicon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Icons</strong> - I will be using <a href="https://fontawesome.com/">Font Awesome</a> for icons needed for the website.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mockup Stage</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Below you will see all the pages using high fidelity software Figma. I decided to use Figma to plot the website so that the look and feel gets as close as possible to the real implementation before I start any code. The main reason behind this is much easier for me to change things at design stage than at coding stage, as well as it would get close to the end product.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is the final mockup for the whole website. Once the prototype is loaded you can navigate through the links in the pages - <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/Pl4PPktv4bRNCnKCihmIjp/Project-Milestone-1?node-id=94%3A5&amp;scaling=min-zoom">view</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technologies">Technologies</h1>
<p>This section is for technologies used in this website. I explain how I used them and a brief description of each.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>CSS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I have used CSS to create custom styles to fit the purpose of my design plan. This has been used as a requirement of this project to describe HTML elements how to be styled and structured. By using the Bootstrap Framework, it reduces dramatically the amount of CSS being used in the project.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>HTML</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>HTML was also a requirement for this project and it was used for the semantic side to give the bare bones of the pages.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>jQuery</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I have used jQuery where I could not use CSS and HTML to achieve a particular feature or to reduce amounts of coding or even to structure the project better.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Javascript</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>jQuery is a library built to write less and do more from Javascript. It is a programming language that allows us to implement more complex pages and features.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>CDN</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I have used the CDN from imagekit to store my images. This is called content delivery network (CDN) which are servers that are geographically distributed around the world to deliver fast internet content by serving from the server closest to the user.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Gitpod</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This is a platform that I have used to write my code. It is and IDE based on VS Code essentially a Software as a Service (SaaS) that gives opportunity to share code, it integrates github, easily test code. It has its drawbacks but for the scope of this project it was more than sufficient.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Github</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I have used github to create the repository for this project and have constantly saved my code through commits locally and then pushed to remote server from github, it uses Git as the version control. The great about using it is that in a way it creates versions of the work done as it is being committed, if something breaks or go terribly wrong it is possible to load the latest working version. Fortunately I have not had critical problems.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Git</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I have used Git as my version control, through the project I have made several commits whenever I made changes to the code. I recognise that I could have made more commits but I got carried with coding at times and not committed in sections where I should have done. This is something I am working on to improve from next project.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="resources">Resources</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Pexels, Unplash and Pixabay</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I have used <a href="https://www.pexels.com/">Pexels</a>, <a href="https://unsplash.com/">Unsplash</a> and <a href="https://pixabay.com/">Pixabay</a> to source all of the images and video that I have used int he project. To know more which images I used please visit the <strong>Credits</strong> section of this document.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Font Awesome &amp; Iconify</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I had initially not planned to use <a href="https://iconify.design/">Iconify</a> but during the mockup stage I have used Iconify for it and for some icons during implementation. In addition, <a href="https://fontawesome.com/">Font Awesome</a> was also used for most of the icons.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Canva</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I have used canva to design some iterations of the logo which you can view them <a href="https://www.canva.com/design/DAEJMth8LoU/S4D2xtRz3mKmKW6sMpT09A/view?utm_content=DAEJMth8LoU&amp;utm_campaign=designshare&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_source=sharebutton">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>StackEdit</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I have come across this small website called <a href="https://stackedit.io">StackEdit</a> where it makes editing of markdown content easily by having a split window where you write your markdown and to visualise updates as you change it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Boostrap</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I have used bootstrap  <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/">documentation</a>. extensively through out this project, so this piece of resource has been crucial to it. Please, check <strong>implementation section</strong> in this document for more details.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>jQuery</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I have used jQuery documentation to remind myself how some of these functions work on this framework.</li>

<h1 id="project-barriers-and-solutions">Project Barriers and Solutions</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Project Scope</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I initially planned to have a lot more done than required because of my background in coding. However, after discussions with my mentor it was decided to down size my initial proposal. So I have cut down from an eCommerce website to a more static one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition, I was initially going to do an ordering system so users would be able to order cakes from the site, it would have a small backend and google maps for users to check location distance and so on. I have turned the ordering section into a photo gallery instead and removed the google maps feature.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bootstrap Framework</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The main challange parts for me was using bootstrap framework, as i have not used it extensively in the past. I took the wrong approach of not going through the documentation in detail. This lead me to do a lot of hard coding css when bootstrap had already had all laid out. After realising this mistake, starting from mid project forward I have extensively used more the framework and less hard coding.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Heavy Loading Website</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In addition, I have had problems with the amount of images in my website. Initially I have just uploaded all images to the project images folder and even after resizing and using <a href="https://tinypng.com/">TINYPNG</a> it still was making the website very heavy to load. So I decided to look for a CDN platform to mitigate this issue. Once I had the images in the CDN the website loaded much faster due to auto compressing and resizing.</li>

<p>Borrowed code, images and videos.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Code Institute - Some concepts I have got from the Love Running website part of Code Institute HTML and CSS studies. The main thing I have used as concept</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>was the cover text in the hero image. However, this was implemented differently using bootstrap and some CSS to reshape the box and placed in a different position.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bootstrap - The majority of the project was completed using Bootstrap framework, I have mainly customised the framework to my own proposed wireframes and mockup as</li>
</ul>
<p>as specfied in the UX section of this document. I have used a lot of the documention from Bootstrap to accomplish the end project.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>jQuery - I have used jQuery for parts of the website, I have mainly used previous knowledge and documentation provided by jQuery.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ImageKit - This is a CDN where I have used to store all images and video.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Video - I have one video that was taken from <a href="http://pexels.com">pexels.com</a> which is a video of a coffee and muffin, which is the only video in the website.</p>
</li>
